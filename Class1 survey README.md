# Class 1 Survey Data Analysis

## Project Description
This repository contains the Class 1 survey dataset and the R code used to analyze it.  
The project is part of an exercise to practice handling real-world data in R, performing basic cleaning, and generating descriptive statistics and visualizations.

## Files Included
- `class1_survey.csv` – Cleaned version of the Class 1 survey dataset  
- `analysis_code.R` – R script used to summarize and visualize the data  
- `README.md` – This file, which explains the project  

## What the Code Does
- Reads in the survey dataset  
- Performs basic data cleaning (renaming variables, handling missing values, filtering)  
- Creates summary statistics (e.g., favorite foods, R experience, favorite season, etc.)  
- Generates bar charts and histograms to visualize survey responses  

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone or download this repository to your computer  
2. Open `analysis_code.R` in RStudio  
3. Ensure your working directory is set to the folder where the files are located  
4. Run the script line by line in RStudio
